## TLDR
OBINexus Computing manuals are set of markdown document written in a conversational blog-like tone for indexed, crawled and queried by search engine . These manual are displayed onto webpage to educate the masses on programming(computer science), art and animation ,physics and mathematics, English literature ,and creative writing  at the very least.  I want to dive into the subject and make sure they are digestible for all humans.
