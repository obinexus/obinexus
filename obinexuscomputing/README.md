# Hi, I'm Nnamdi Michael Okpala! üëã

**Welcome to OBINexus Computing: Computing from the Heart**

## About Me
I‚Äôm Nnamdi Michael Okpala, founder of OBINexus Computing. As an Igbo man with Autism and a mild learning disability, I hold a Level 3 Project Management Certificate in IT. I thrive in content creation and blogging.

## Slogan
**"OBINexus Computing ‚Äì Computing from the Heart"**

Our logo symbolizes accessibility needs, embodying our mission to develop and maintain technology for everyone. "OBI" means heart in Igbo, and "nexus" signifies connection.

## Motto
**‚ÄúBuild with Purpose, Run with Heart‚Äù**

With hyperfocus as an autistic individual, I meticulously plan and execute projects, distinguishing between exploratory and systematic implementations.

## Project Management Insights
Projects fall into two categories:
1. Investigative projects (proof of concept).
2. Systematic implementation projects.

Emphasizing work-life balance is crucial for sustained success in the software development lifecycle, comprising:
1. Requirements
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Maintenance

**‚ÄúLove what you do.‚Äù - Steve Jobs**  
For me, completing projects is a passion, even amidst challenges.

## Foundation Problems at OBINexus Computing
We identify foundational problems to enhance design and technology solutions, encouraging open communication within our team for research and development. We advocate for digital rights as human rights, highlighting the need for maintenance of technology, especially in economically disadvantaged areas.

## Addressing the Digital Divide
The digital divide hinders equality, affecting marginalized communities' access to technology and digital literacy. We must promote equitable access and robust digital skills training to empower all individuals.

## Accessibility Solutions
As someone with Autism and a Learning Disability, my goal is to innovate and address user needs by integrating accessibility features in software design.

## STEM and Accessibility
**Context:** STEM disciplines are vital for solving real-world problems, yet solutions must be culturally tailored.

**Objective:** Develop methodologies that incorporate local contexts and values in the design process for effective and culturally relevant infrastructure.
